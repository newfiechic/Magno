# Magno (Codename)

Magno is a private, in-development trading bot framework designed for perpetuals trading on Hyperliquid.

It uses a combination of machine learning, adaptive execution logic, and modular strategy modes to respond to live market conditions with precision.

Most internal modules and data are currently `.gitignored` while development continues.
